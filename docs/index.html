          I'm an aspiring writer. About a year after I graduated from college, I
          read On the Road, and I was so inspired I decided to try and make a
          career of it. I've had a heck of a time making it work, but that's how
          it goes in this racket.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the day, I work as a frontend software engineer. That means I
          spend my days coding web interfaces. Currently I'm working at a
          company called <a href="https://iterable.com/">Iterable</a>. Before
          that I was at <a href="https://accenture.com/">Accenture</a>. And
          before <em>that</em>, I actually worked as a biologist, doing bird
          surveys in different parts of the U.S. I worked for outfits like USGS,
          Point Blue, and Bird Conservancy of the Rockies. I got to see a lot of
          the country, and learned a few things about the land and the people
          who live on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working, I love to go hiking and birdwatching, learn jiu
          jitsu, and spend time with my friends and family.
