          35 lbs in 6 weeks. This excerpt pretty much sums it up:

            started gagging.

          <a href="https://www.val.town/">Val Town</a> -- Val Town is a way to
          write and run Javascript snippets on the web. Very cool to think about
          what's possible with this!

      <h3>Physical products</h3>
      <p>I'm one of those people who's super particular about what they buy.</p>

      <h4>Clothing</h4>
      <ul class="ml-4">
        <li>
          <b>Socks</b>:
          <a
            href="https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/products/E461024-000/00?colorDisplayCode=09&sizeDisplayCode=027&pldDisplayCode=000"
            >Uniqlo Low-cut Socks</a
          >
          at <b>$5/pair</b>. Yes, some socks are better than others. But should
          I pay
          <a
            href="https://bombas.com/products/men-s-solid-ankle-sock-white-large-1?variant=black&size=l"
          >
            $13 for a pair</a
          >? <b>Hell no</b>! I've tried Bombas. I've tried Smartwool. I've tried
          Darn Tough. They're all fine. But they aren't <i>even a little</i> bit
          longer-lasting or more comfortable than these Uniqlo socks. Buy Uniqlo
          socks. Bombas, don't make me pay for your egregiously overprevalent
          marketing campaigns.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Boxer Briefs</b>:
          <a
            href="https://www.costco.com/kirkland-signature-men%27s-boxer-brief%2C-4-pack.product.100323810.html"
            >Kirkland Signature Boxer Briefs</a
          >
          at <b>$4.25/pair</b>. Likewise, I've tried a bunch of different brands
          of boxer briefs. Mack Weldon? MeUndies? These are all Power-MBA
          companies. They zero-in on easily-produced, high profit-margin items
          -- like, boxer-briefs, t-shirts, or socks -- make above-average
          products, and market them to hell. The problem with easily-produced
          items, of course, is that... well, they're easily produced. It's a
          crowded market, so they have to spend a lot on marketing to promote
          their brand. And who ends up paying for those huge marketing
          campaigns? That's right, <b>you do</b>. It's
          <b>baked into the ticket price</b>. Don't pay for marketing. Buy
          Costco.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Glasses</b>:
          <a href="https://www.warbyparker.com/">Warby Parker</a> glasses at
          <b>$95/pair</b>. You can go cheaper. I actually own a few pairs from
          <a href="https://www.eyebuydirect.com/">EyeBuyDirect</a> that were
          priced between $35 and $75, and I like them almost as much as my Warby
          Parkers. But the quality is definitely a little bit lower. Warby
          Parkers are nicely designed, solid quality, and affordable. Sold sold
          and sold.

          <b>Jacket</b>:
          <a
            href="https://www.patagonia.com/product/mens-nano-puff-jacket/84212.html?dwvar_84212_color=BLK"
            >Patagonia Nano-Puff Jacket</a
          >
          at <b>$225</b>. I'm not exactly avant garde here. Plenty of people own
          this jacket. And frankly, I don't especially want anyone else to buy
          it. But it's so damned nice that I couldn't leave it out. This is the
          single most versatile piece of clothing I own. It's so compressible
          that you can pack it into your back pocket. It's surprisingly warm -
          comfortable until about 45 degrees F with a T-shirt underneath. And
          amazingly, despite how formless and lightweight it is, it doesn't look
          like crap when you wear it. It actually looks pretty good. I've worn
          this out to dinner, out to bars, to work functions. It'll work with
          button-ups and slacks, and it'll work with a shorts and a t-shirt.
